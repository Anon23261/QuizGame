# QuizGame
Python Game
Key Components of This Game

Functions: display_intro, get_questions, ask_question, and run_quiz are functions that encapsulate specific parts of the game.
Data Structures: Each question is stored as a dictionary, and all questions are in a list. This structure helps keep the code clean and allows for easy expansion.
Conditionals and Loops: The game includes a for loop to iterate over questions and if conditions to check answers and manage user input.
User Input Handling: ask_question ensures valid input, handling incorrect inputs gracefully with a try/except block.
